- added Torus as new shape

## VERSION 1.1.1

- fixed a bug in the point-light renderer algorithm;

- modified the scenefile examples;
  
## VERSION 1.1.0

## VERSION 0.2.0

- Feature: it's possible to create animations of `demo` (required [ffmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org) software)
  
- Implemented `demo` function: two possible world versions can be rendered

- Implemented `PCG` random number generator (see Melissa E. Oâ€™Neill (2014), ["PCG: A Family of Simple Fast Space-Efficient Statistically Good Algorithms for Random Number Generation"](https://www.pcg-random.org/paper.html)

- Implemented Renderers: `OnOffRenderer`, `FlatRRenderer`, `PathTracer`

- Implemented BRDFs: `BRDF`, `DiffuseBRDF`, `SpecularBRDF`
  
- Implemented Pigments: `Pigment`, `UniformPigment`, `CheckeredPigment`, `ImagePigment`

- Implemented Shapes: `Shape`, `Sphere`, `World`, `Plane`
  
- First bug fixed in the code (!); see PR[#7](https://github.com/cosmofico97/Raytracing/pull/7#issue-630790415))
  
- Implemented interface from command line
  
- Implemented a first main interface

## VERSION 0.1.0
