# DEMO WORLD B
# This is a simple tutorial scene-file that explains the basic syntax
# of how scene can be defined for this program.
# 
# In order to check the correct behaviour of this file (i.e. that is correctly parsed,
# without throwing exceptions, and render the demo image of the world type "B") run the 
# following command in the CLI (or another equivalent):
#
#    ./Raytracer.jl render examples/demo_world_B.txt pathtracer
#
# You should obtain the same image if you run the demo command with the world "B":
#
#   ./Raytracer.jl demo --world_type="B" --camera_position="[-2, 0, 1]" pathtracer 
#
# And now let's start explaining how to define a scene!


# First of all, let's define the materials of the objects
MATERIAL sky_material (
        DIFFUSE( UNIFORM(<0, 0, 0>) ),
        UNIFORM( <1.0, 0.9, 0.5> )      # This will be our light source for this scene!
)

MATERIAL ground_material (
        DIFFUSE( CHECKERED( <0.3, 0.5, 0.1> ,  <0.1, 0.2, 0.5> , 2 ) ),
        UNIFORM( <0, 0, 0> )
)

MATERIAL sphere_material (
        DIFFUSE( UNIFORM( to_RGB(0, 128, 240) ) ),
        UNIFORM( <0, 0, 0> )
)

MATERIAL mirror_material (
        DIFFUSE( UNIFORM( to_RGB(232, 10, 10) ) ),
        UNIFORM( <0, 0, 0> )
)

MATERIAL mirror_material_2 (
        DIFFUSE( UNIFORM( to_RGB(178, 255, 102) ) ),
        UNIFORM( <0, 0, 0> )
)

MATERIAL triangle_material(
	DIFFUSE(UNIFORM( to_RGB(190, 24, 120) ) ),
    UNIFORM( <0, 0, 0> ) 
)

# All the shapes implemented in this program (exception made for triangles)
# are created by default as "unitary", i.e. :
# - the spheres are centered in the origin with radius 1
# - the cubes are axis-aligned, centered in the origin with side 1
# - the planes are created as the x-y plane (i.e. all the 3D point with z-component =0)
# In order to create an arbitrary sized-placed-oriented shape, you must apply to the
# unitary shape the appropriate sequence of transformations!

# The transformations defined in this software are:
# - IDENTITY : the identity transformation
# - SCALING : a scaling transformation, must take as input a 3D vector defining the scaling
# - ROTATION_X : a left-handed rotation around the x axis; it must take as
#        input a float number defining the rotation angle IN RADIANTS 
# - ROTATION_Y : a left-handed rotation around the you axis; it must take as
#        input a float number defining the rotation angle IN RADIANTS 
# - ROTATION_Z : a left-handed rotation around the z axis; it must take as
#        input a float number defining the rotation angle IN RADIANTS 

# The Coordinate System is defined as follows, for a default camera (placed in [-1,0,0],
# i.e  X = -1, Y = 0, Z = 0, see later):
# - the positive x-axis is entering in the display of the observer;
# - the positive x-axis is oriented on the left of the observer;
# - the positive z-axis is oriented on the top of the observer;

# The positive sign for the rotations of all the three axis is given, as already said,
# the right-hand rule, therefore a clockwise rotation for entering (x,y,z)-axis 
# corresponds to a positive input rotation angle. 

# You can concatenate an arbitrary number of transformations through the star symbol "*";
# the application order for the transformations is FROM RIGHT TO LEFT! 

# Now let's define an object!
SPHERE(
    sky_material,   # material to be used
    SCALING([50, 50, 50]) * TRANSLATION([0, 0, 0]) # transformations to apply on the shape
)

# for the previous sphere, first is applied a TRANSLATION of a vector [0,0,0] (i.e.
# no translation) and therefore a SCALING of 50 on all the three axes (i.e. the sphere
# it's made bigger with a factor of 50 on the radius)

# All the other shapes are defined in the same manner!

PLANE(
    ground_material,
    IDENTITY 
)

PLANE(
    mirror_material_2,
    TRANSLATION([0., -2., 0]) * ROTATION_Z(pi/6.) * ROTATION_X(pi/2.) 
)

FLOAT s1(0.6)
FLOAT s2(1.0)

SPHERE(
    sphere_material,
    TRANSLATION([0, 0, 0.3]) * SCALING([s1, s1, s1])
)

SPHERE(
    mirror_material,
    TRANSLATION([0.4, 1.5, 0]) * SCALING([s2, s2, s2])
)

CUBE(
    mirror_material,
	TRANSLATION([0.3, -1.5, 0]) * SCALING([s2, s2, s2])
)

# For the triangle shape, you have to specify (after the material) the three points 
# that defines the triangle itself (instead of the transformation), in a vector-like
# syntax
TRIANGLE( 
    triangle_material,
	[2.0, 1.0, 0.0], [3.0, -1.0, 0.0], [2.5, 0.0, 1.0]
)

# The definition of the CAMERA (i.e. the point of view) works like follows:
# - first argument : choosen projection , PERSPECTIVE or ORTHOGONAL
# - second argument : transformation defining the point of view and the orientation
# The third argument depends on the choosen projection:
# - for PERSPECTIVE, you must insert a float defining the distance from the screen
# - for ORTHOGONAL, nothing has to be further inserted (because the orthogonal 
#       projection it's a specifical perspective projection with an infinite distance
#       between the observer and the screen)
#
# NOTE: in previous versions, you have to specify the aspect ratio of the rendered image;
# howeve, this created problems with the specification of the width and height pixel number
# of the image (aaspect_ratio != width / height), so this value is from now on inferred
# in the render function.
#

CAMERA(
    PERSPECTIVE, 
    TRANSLATION([-2, 0, 1]), 
    1.0
)

# If you do not define a camera, the following default one will be used:
#   CAMERA(
#       PERSPECTIVE,
#       TRANSLATION([-1, 0, 0]),
#       1.0,
#   )

# Last but not least, it's appropriate to define also a pointlight source.
# This source does matter only if you choose to render the image with
# the `pointlight` renderer algorithm, but in such case is required
# (otherwise all the image would appear black!)

POINTLIGHT(
    [-1.0, 4.0, 2.0], 
    <1.0, 1.0, 1.0>
)
