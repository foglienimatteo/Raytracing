# EARTH AND SUN
# Here we create an image of the earth and the Sun inside the Milky-Way.
# In order to render this image, run in the CLI:
#
#    ./Raytracer.jl render examples/earth_and_sun.txt --width=1200 --height=900 flat
#
# or in the Julia REPL:
#
#    render("scenefile"=>"examples/earth_and_sun.txt", "width"=>1200, "height"=>900, "%COMMAND%"=>"flat")
#
# As you probably have already read in the README.md, there are four possible renderer algorithms.
# Each of them connects with different rules the color of a pixel and the light ray that starts
# from that pixel and hit (or not) an object of the rendered scene:
# - onoff : each pixel is set to the "background_color" if no shape is hitten by its light ray, 
#         otherwise is set to "color"; this renderer exists only for debugging purposes
# - flat : each pixel is set to the "background_color" if no shape is hitten by its light ray, 
#         otherwise is set to the color of the hitted shape point; this renderer is very efficient,
#         but it does not solve the rendering equation.
#         Consequently, no shadows or brightness are rendered.
# - pathtracer : this is the TRUE renderer. It solves the rendering equation in the "standard"
#         way, and for this reason its very burdensome to be used, specifically for the rendereing
#         times needed to create the image.
#         Nevertheless, the rendered images are incomparably more realistic that the ones
#         maded with the other three renderers; USE THIS RENDERER WITH FORESIGHT!
# - pointlight : it's the "cheap solution" for a realistic image. This renderer creates an image
#         setting each pixel colored or not depending on the "line of sight" between that point
#         and the point-light sources in the scene.
#         It's very fast, and the images rendered are perfect for an astrophysical context or for
#         very bright days of summer; it's, nevertheless, a simple solution in order to avoid
#         the longer times needed for the pathtracer algorithm.

# This type of image is very long to be rendered with "pathtracer"; moreover, for the
# rendering of astrophysical images, it's useless; use "pointlight" renderer instead!

# Here we see a new feature. For the pointlight renderer, it often useful to create
# shapes in the scene that 
# - "represents" a light source (as the Sun), and so that would "contain" a point-light; but we must
#    then tell to the renderer that this shape does not hide all the shapes outside!
# - "represents" a background object (as the Milky Way), and so that would not be interested
#    if they are directly visible or not from any of the point-light sources; it's color is determinated
#    only by their pigment. 
#
# In order to render this two patricular types of shapes, you can optionally specify in the
# definition of a shape to render in a scene two bool variables:
# - the first bool is for the "flag_pointlight", i.e. for prevent the darkening due to
#    the hiding of this shape taht "cointains" a point-light
# - the second bool is for the "flag_background", i.e. for prevent shadows on a shape that
#    we want to use as background
#
# NOTE : when you define a shape, you can also not specify this bools (as in the previous cases),
# and they will be automatically set both to "false"; however, you cannot specify one of them only:
# both or no-one!
